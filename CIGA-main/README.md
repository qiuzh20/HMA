# HMA for GNN in OOD tasks

Code for combining HMM with GNN backbones for various OOD tasks follow [CIGA: Causality Inspired Invariant Graph LeArning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05441).

## Requirements

Basic setups please refer `./original-README.md`

## Usage

### Training

To reproduce the results in the paper, run the commands in `./scripts/HMA_exp.sh`.

#### Baselines

Follow CIGA in `./scripts/others.sh` and `./scripts/tu_datasets.sh`.
